## vestascenes ðŸš€

This is a vestaboard server implementation which organizes the vestaboard (http://vestaboard.com) related content within scenes.

This helps to prioritize the content which you are interested in. The implementation contains scenes for ChatGPT
requests, Strava-Stats and some other random content generating scenes.


### Key concept
The key concept behind the app are scenes which are executed by a Director on a regular basis. Each scene announces with its priority response how important the current scene content is.
This information will be taken by the Director into account to calculate which scene is next.




### Container Setup
The application is orchestrated by docker compose and is currently organized in two main applications:
#### API
Contain the business logic of vesta-control.
#### Runner
The runner is a container with one python application which is triggering the http://api/execute endpoint every 15 seconds. Thanks to this the application logic resists within the api container and is triggered periodically within the given interval.


### TODOS
- Space Launch Alerts => Display when a SpaceX liftoff happens
- add mermaid diagram which describes how vestascenes works
- when a high priority scene is overruling an existing one (based on higher priority), the old one will afterwards not be displayed again. Instead a new scene is generated
- Create scene which shows a countdown towards fusion or other nice events like vacations etc.
- add multiple birthday graphics
- optimize init-snapshots performance
- add hints towards the status service to guide users to configure the service properly
- https://storybook.vestaboard.com/?path=/docs/docs--docs I'd start with npm create vite - answer the questions regarding stack and frameworks and you have a great modern dev server setup for you already with build scripts and some demo content
as for docker - you can either mount the built files npm run build into nginx directly (recommended) or play around with base node container (docker init ) and run npm run serve as entrypointÂ 

## Cheat Sheet
### Debugging / deploy tips:
```bash
# Manual start on Mac:
sudo docker-compose up --build -d

# get all log statements of running containers
docker-compose logs -f

# check which containers are up and running
sudo docker-compose watch

# log interactively into container
docker exec -ti vestaboard-api-1 /bin/sh

########## fetch new sources from git and rebuild ##########
# stop current project in container manager!
cd /volume1/docker/vestaboard/

# remove local git changes (if required)
git restore .

# refresh rom git
git pull origin main

# rebuild the container:
sudo docker-compose build --no-cache api

# trigger "Aktion -> Bereinigen" of the project
# trigger "Aktion -> Erstellen" of the project
```
